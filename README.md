# What do?

Some notes about collaborative ways of working.

### How to start?

* Start with user story mapping -> stories (everyone)
* Then continue with feature/example mapping -> concrete examples for stories (smaller group)
* And then you can write specifications -> gherkin (PM + dev + QA)
* Finally dive into executable specification -> cucumber (dev + QA)

**This means:**

Short iterations, preferred time for one iteration should be few hours!

```
Story --> Build --> Release --> Feedback --> Change --> Story --> ...
```

### Questions after every session

* What did we do well?
* What have we learned?
* What can we do better?
* What puzzles us?
* What interrupted us?
